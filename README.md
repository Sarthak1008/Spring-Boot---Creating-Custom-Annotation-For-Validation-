Creating custom annotations for validation in a Spring Boot project can be quite useful when you need to enforce specific constraints on your domain objects that are not covered by the standard JSR-380 annotations like @NotNull, @NotBlank, @Size, etc. Custom annotations allow you to encapsulate complex validation logic into reusable components and provide a cleaner and more expressive way to define validation rules for your application.
Here's a basic outline of how you can create and use custom annotations for validation in a Spring Boot project:

Define the Custom Annotation:

<p> Create a new annotation interface and annotate it with @Constraint. This annotation tells Spring that this interface is a constraint annotation.</p>
<p>Implement the Constraint Validator:Create a class that implements the ConstraintValidator interface. This class will contain the actual validation logic. </p>
<p>Using the Custom Annotation: Now you can use your custom annotation @ValidateEmployeeType on fields in your domain objects.</p>
<p> Validating Objects: In your service or controller classes, you can use Spring's validation capabilities to validate objects annotated with your custom annotation.</p>
